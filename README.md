# Exploring Rural-Urban Disparities in the Consumption of Essential Nutritional Foods Among Women in Tamil Nadu, India

## Objective
This study aims to explore the disparities in the consumption of essential nutritional foods, specifically milk and rice, among women in Tamil Nadu, India. It focuses on contrasting rural and urban sectors to uncover significant differences and the underlying factors driving these disparities.

## Actions
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Utilized time-series data on consumer expenditure from the 68th round (2011-12) survey by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).
   - Focused on women aged 20-50 years and analyzed their consumption of milk and rice, along with other factors such as age, education, marital status, possession of ration card, and household size.

2. **Theoretical Framework:**
   - Applied the Nutrition Transition Theory to understand changes in dietary consumption patterns with socioeconomic development.
   - Utilized probit regression models to analyze the data.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Conducted descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
   - Performed probit regression analyses to determine the factors affecting 'good consumption' of milk and rice.

## Results
1. **Milk Consumption:**
   - Urban residency, age, and education positively influence the likelihood of good milk consumption.
   - Household size and possession of a ration card negatively impact milk consumption.
   - Marital status (married or widowed) increases the probability of good milk consumption.
   - The predicted probability of good milk consumption in the sample is 25.76%.

2. **Rice Consumption:**
   - Urban residency is positively associated with good rice consumption.
   - Education negatively influences rice consumption, likely due to increased awareness of healthier dietary choices.
   - Household size and possession of a ration card negatively impact rice consumption.
   - Marital status (married or divorced) negatively affects rice consumption.
   - The predicted probability of good rice consumption in the sample is 36.33%.

## Conclusion
The study reveals significant urban-rural disparities in the consumption of milk and rice among women in Tamil Nadu. Urban women are more likely to consume greater quantities of both milk and rice compared to their rural counterparts. Factors such as education, marital status, and possession of a ration card play crucial roles in influencing dietary habits. These findings highlight the necessity for specialized interventions to mitigate nutritional disparities and improve public health outcomes.

## Limitations
- The study uses data from 2011-12, which may not reflect current consumption patterns.
- Key variables such as income, prices, and employment status were not included in the analysis.
- The model's explanatory power is limited, as indicated by a lower Pseudo R square value.
